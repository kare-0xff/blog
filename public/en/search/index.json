[{"content":"Begin: I went to Xiaopo Station as usual. Although I am not an Android professional, but with the foundation of iOS jailbreak, a broken Android phone and the WSA launched on Windows 11, I began to understand some things in the field of Android. , The big data is really powerful. After swiping and swiping, they sent me a video of Xiaomi box brushing AndroidTV. I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect TV boxes to do this. This moment reminded me of being dominated by various advertising pop-ups of Xiaomi boxes. Fear, this time it is saved, without saying a word, just start working. ü§£\nü§îWhat is the AndroidTV? AndroidTV is a smart TV platform developed by Google\nThe whole system occupies a small space, there are no advertisements, the animations and ui are very good-looking, and the Google service is built-in. Anyway, it is probably such a thing. Generally, if you want to use this system, you need to buy some TV boxes of the international version.\nüòÖStart: Turn on the TV, and have a brief look at the model of the TV box. Mine is MDZ-16-AA, with only 4g of memory, and I have only installed two software. For the special card, it is estimated that it is only a dozen frames. The usb port is poor, so I gave one\u0026hellip; The process of flashing the phone is similar to that of an Android phone. It is also to flash twrp first, and then use twrp to flash other systems. In order to be lazy, I follow the The simple method on the Internet is to downgrade the box first, then root, and then flash into twrp, and then I overturned the car. I thought the TV box was bricked, but I checked it online, but I didn‚Äôt expect to save the brick. It can be said that God helped me. , After taking a closer look at the method, it is not difficult but rather troublesome. The specific process will not go into detail. There are many online. The following is a record of the pits I encountered\u0026hellip;\nI don\u0026rsquo;t have a male-to-male usb cable, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to wait for the courier, so I made one. Seriously, I won\u0026rsquo;t die if I don\u0026rsquo;t do it. I connected the homemade cable to the two usb ports on the laptop, and the laptop burned out. Broken a usb port, it hurts me to death, sorry, it seems that this cable can\u0026rsquo;t be used, so I can only buy one obediently At first, I didn\u0026rsquo;t know that the Mi box must be connected to the computer and other usb devices, and the adb debugging mode must be turned on. As a result, after entering the recovery mode, twrp automatically deletes the built-in system, resulting in only twrp when booting, and then the remote control and mouse cannot be used. , entered a dead end with serious consequences To use the remote control to enter the automatic flashing machine, you must first delete the connection of the remote control in the Xiaomi box, otherwise you will not want to use the remote control to enter the automatic flashing machine, because I have been doing this step for a long time, and then I saw the solution on the Internet. scheme, and different models have different buttons to enter the automatic flashing machine, a batch of pits Many Android resources on the Internet are unavailable, and various assistants and root tools are also ineffective. The resources are very complicated, which is really annoying. It took several hours just to find various resources. To save the bricks, the millet box needs to be disassembled. It is impossible to open this thing by hand. It took about an hour and a half to disassemble it with tools, and the hands are useless. To connect to the computer after disassembly, you must short-circuit the 2 and 3 contacts at the moment of plugging in, and try repeatedly until you connect to the computer and use a software to force the system into the system, but various errors will be reported, and it will not work after many attempts. , the error is reported only 4%, it is best to check a lot of information before seeing a related content, the reason is that this software has problems running on amd, but my intel mini host is installed with macos, so I want to save the box. I can only install the small host back to Windows, and finally successfully solved the error üòçThe effect after a series of tossing: Android versionÔºöAndroid5.1.1\nFirmware comes with supersu\nSupport Google Play Store and YouTube\nand so on\u0026hellip;\nüòÖLet me see: Sorry for the bad shot, just take a look\nü§îThe experience after the box is flashed Generally speaking, it is very good, at least there are no ads and all kinds of memory are insufficient, but it is still a bit difficult to watch YouTube with crash in the box, because the box has insufficient computing power, so it can only be reluctant. It is recommended to use a soft router or a router. Patriotic Internet Directly\nüòÖTake it to the next level After tossing a series of millet boxes, once again with the help of big data, I flashed an ancient project: Android TV X86, which is really a link, just in front of me, the mini host has flashed windows, anyway, mainly With my laptop, I might as well flash it to AndroidTV, which can also solve the problem of slow Internet access in patriotism. With the large capacity of the hard disk, this garbage can be put to good use. The ancient cpu of i3-4360 runs Android can kill most ordinary TV boxes in seconds, just do it\u0026hellip;\nüòçLet me see: ü§îSo,What is the Android TV X86 Android TV x86 created by developer AmznUser444 Dev. Because the root of the ROM is the Android-x86 project. The initial version was based on Android 9 Pie, and its system requirements only required a 1.2 GHz dual-core 64-bit capable processor, and a typical Intel/NVIDIA/AMD GPU with 64MB of video memory.\nSimply put, it is a system that allows your computer to run Android TV.\nü•±Find the resources you need This thing seems to be produced by only two foreign teams. In order to get the latest version, I Googled it and joined the discord of these two teams, but one of them seems to have not been developed, and the version is stuck at Android 9 Only the other one is still under slow development. The latest AndroidTV version is Android11, but the author will charge for mirror download, about 10 euros. Anyway, I really can't afford it, so I only Can download its free version, the free one is Android 9`, comfort yourself and say: It\u0026rsquo;s enough anyway.\nAfter some understanding and practice, the AndroidTV x86 produced by the team that has not been developed encountered some problems during the installation process. It is estimated that my food or mirroring is not good, so it is recommended to use the AndroidTV that is still under maintenance.\nü§îpractice process Partition the hard disk in advance, and set the name of the hard disk to remember. The format is set to ext4. I probably divided it into 64GB, but in fact, I don\u0026rsquo;t need so much, it\u0026rsquo;s too wasteful, 10G is probably enough.
